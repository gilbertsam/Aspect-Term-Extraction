( for those of you who don't know, uni is sea urchin in japanese, which happens to be my favorite.)  he served me an uni hand roll, which i never had before, and let me tell you...it was heaven! aside from the sea urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including fatty yellow tail, boton shrimp, blue fin torro (fatty tuna), sea eel, etc. the sake menu should not be overlooked! all in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city. try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll.\",\n",

       "  ' possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city! not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city. if you’re planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky!). it’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘excuse me’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth! my party had the bbe $29 fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake! i never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it. we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche. our first course was tuna sashimi with green yuzu sauce. i picked the grilled black cod as my entree, which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better. the entrees were served with miso soup and rice. the sake’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world. for desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal. maybe it was the great company (i had friends visiting from philly – yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but i just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie. i don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but i’ll come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.',\n",
